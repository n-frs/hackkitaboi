                Staged passionately by the excellent theater arts group of our school,
          Tanghalang Don Mariano (TDM), last December 7, 2022 at the
          Audio-Visual Room of DMMMSU-NLUC; Makikitawag Lang Ako is an
          adaptation by Teresa ‚ÄúRisa‚Äù Jopson from Gabriel Garcia Marquez‚Äôs I
          Only Came to Use the Phone; one of the twelve short stories from her
          book Doce cuentos peregrinos (Twelve Pilgrim Stories).
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Centered on mental health awareness and the irrationality of the
          authority, Makikitawag Lang Ako revolves around a woman who
          accidentally joined an inbound patients from a mental hospital while
          she desperately shouts for help with her car being stuck in the middle
          of the road while heavy rain is pouring. Only the bus containing those
          mental patients stopped by to aid the struggling woman. The woman only
          asked for a phone to contact her husband, a magician, waiting for
          their three events, but the driver insisted to take her for a ride.
          Unaware of their destination, the woman trusted the drivers until they
          arrived in an old gloomy place. Little she don‚Äôt know that their
          destination is actually a hospital with abusive, irrational, and
          unethical staves and doctors.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Dissecting the story for codes, I just realize that I haven‚Äôt paid
          attention on the love and romantic parts of the play. But those are
          the highlights and catchy parts of it. Where issues about
          communication, maintaining a relationship and illogical decisions were
          being portrayed. Sensitive issues such as abuse, rape, manipulation,
          suicide, and false diagnosis/claims were also packed in this story.
          These topics are meant to be understood by the youth as these are the
          most stigmatized ones by the majority. It takes courage to perform
          these kind of scenes for the young artists, yet they pulled it off in
          a professional level despite being amateurs.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          This adaptation by Risa Jopson, and by the direction of Uno Juan,
          modified the protagonist, Maria de la Luz Cervantes into a more kinky,
          sassy woman; enough for me to have a dilemma whether she‚Äôs actually
          out of her mind, and that whatever happened before she arrived in that
          hospital are just hallucinations and delusions caused by whatever
          illness she has. But as the story goes by, I‚Äôm convinced that she‚Äôs
          not out of her mind and I, somehow anticipated some parts of the play,
          since I‚Äôve read Marquez‚Äôs I Only Came to Use the Phone. Saturno ‚ÄòD
          Magician, the deuteragonist of the story, Maria‚Äôs husband, took bad
          decisions in the story. I nearly jumped out of my seat when he did buy
          Dr. Bong Bong‚Äôs and the hospital‚Äôs staves‚Äô fake showcase of morals and
          professionalism when he visited Maria after months of her sufferings.
          Well, that‚Äôs part of the show, to move and convince the audience then
          show something that they‚Äôll not expect. Also, the director got me with
          the names of minor characters which happened to be people in
          politics‚ÄîDr. Bong Bong, Robin Padilla, Bato, etc.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs hilarious to witness political humor again; but this time it
          blended and used in theater with subtle but powerful hints. Perhaps
          others are not into these kind of humor given their own political
          stands. But personally, I salute the director for using such fresh
          names and issues instead of unfamiliar and boring names. Those minor
          characters caught the attention of the audience despite them being
          minor characters. That‚Äôs the power of being creative.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          When it comes to the acting and skills of the artists I cannot see any
          flaw as an average audience. There‚Äôs even a part of the play that I
          cannot tell whether it‚Äôs an act or a fluke. It‚Äôs too surreal to think
          that the artists possesses such level of skill, and to call them
          amateurs isn‚Äôt appropriate, as the way they act is no doubt,
          professional level. Be it a violent, intimate, sensitive,
          nerve-wrecking, comedic, or even romantic and sex scenes; you name it,
          they pulled it off with their very real punches, slaps, kisses,
          appropriate facial expressions, actions, and gestures. Their costumes
          and make-ups are metaphorical and might seem off for someone who read
          the original story by Marquez. They incorporated the elements of
          clowns to portray insanity. Magicians might also be a symbol of
          illusions and tricks; hence our brain being the responsible organ for
          tricking ourselves with illusions. The only look that stood out from
          the majority was Maria‚Äôs. Her‚Äôs was a basic student coat and a pair of
          beach shoes, implying that she‚Äôs well and that she doesn‚Äôt really have
          any mental illness. At the beginning of the play, the artists wore
          their insane attires to portray certain mental illnesses while some
          information about the current state of mental health in the
          Philippines was being delivered through audio. Some artists
          crossed-dressed, some wore exaggerated clothes, and some only wore an
          underwear. What they did helped the audience on visualizing the
          statistical figures that the audio presented.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Trigger warnings, disclaimers, the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of the theater were
          delivered through the use of audio. They could have at least projected
          or flashed a short video regarding these warnings and rules but the
          audio was captivating with its humor, so I‚Äôll let that pass.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Delving to their set design and venue of the play, upon falling in
          line and signing for registration, I‚Äôm in awe when a character popped
          out of nowhere holding a ‚ÄúPALIMOS‚Äù sign. The show did not started yet,
          but a powerful element acting as a hint for the theme of the show is
          right there, on our very space. That‚Äôs a huge plus for me. Upon
          entering the Audio-Visual room, another character is seen at the
          center of the stage with green hue of light beaming on him while he
          messily eats a bag of chips (BTW, the artist behind that character is
          one of my dormmates). That‚Äôs another powerful teaser on what the show
          is all about. Their props are the most interesting ones because
          whoever the person behind it did a job well done. The witty mind
          behind the props knew that gigantic and grand props will be hard to
          deal with in that limited space so they improvised with toy cars,
          flashlights, dolls, facade of a bus, blankets, garters, and the body
          of the artists as props. I actually thought that this adaptation will
          be far from what I‚Äôve read, because I cannot see how they‚Äôll going to
          pull off every scene. All I can say to myself is that I underestimated
          the power of creative improvisation. Hanged elements on the walls of
          the theater are also seen, and that these aligns with the theme of the
          story.

          The lighting had a huge role during the execution of the play, they
          used colors to imbue and magnify emotions being evoked by a particular
          scene. White light as the main, general lighting for the story; Red
          for intense, violent, those too much to take-in scenes, and some super
          intimate ones; Purple when a valuable information about something is
          being said (when Dr. Bong Bong speaks); Yellow when gloomy emotions
          and self-pity are kicking. The light technician know how to manipulate
          the scene‚Äôs emotions by just throttling some colors. We can‚Äôt just
          neglect the presence of music too throughout the play. They used
          teasing songs and soundtracks, they amplified the performance of the
          artists and the power of lighting by just playing the right soundtrack
          during the play.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          All-in-all, the team know their craft well. For the elements of drama
          are embedded and used well in every second of the show. Gosh, the
          professionalism of these people drove me insane. Paying fifty pesos
          for a ticket isn‚Äôt enough to justify and reward their talents,
          efforts, and skills. Tanghalang Don Mariano deserves exposure and
          recognition.
